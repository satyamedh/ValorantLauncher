# Valorant Launcher

# WHERE'S THE EXE YOU SMELLY NERD?
## [here](https://github.com/satyamedh/ValorantLauncher/releases) (Assuming you've installed val in the default location in your C drive. if not, better learn compiling dotnet :P)

## Why does this exist?
### The default shortcut for launching val is a shortcut to the riot launcher with a few arguements. When adding said shortcut to steam, it backtracks and therefore just launches the riot launcher instead of val

## What does this do?
### Just do the same thing the shortcut does, but since this is an EXE and not a shortcut, steam won't backtrack for the original EXE.

## B-But virus!
### The source code is all here, I aint responsible for whatever the fk you manage to do with this.

## Rito pls dont sue me for taking your logo
